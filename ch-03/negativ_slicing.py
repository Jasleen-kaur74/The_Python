name = "Mustang"

print(name[0:3])

print(name[-7:-4])
# to identify this just do this : convert them into the corresponding positive ones
# length -4 and then lenth -1 here simply
#  so here lenth = 7 so 7-4 = 3 and 7-1 = 6
# so here                     M    U    S    T    A    N    G
#                             0    1    2    3    4    5    6
# so the negavtive ones      -7   -6   -5   -4   -3   -2   -1

print(name[:4])  # this means 0:4
print(name[4:])  # this means 4: length so it will print upto the end that is the 6th one
