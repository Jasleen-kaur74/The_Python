    """here this code will print
         1
         2
         3
         4
         5
         6
         7 
        In while loop first the condition is checked and here the condition is that if i is less thn 8
        as here the value of i is initially 1 so it means it is less than 8 and hence the condition becomes true
        and the value of i is printed and and then we have written i+=1 which means that now i = i+1 
        so the value of i becomes 2 and as 2 is also smaller than 8 it again gets printed and hence this goes on 
        until 8 cuz when that value of i becomes 8 the condition in while loop is checked and here the value is same 
        that is 8 is equal to 8 not less than so here the loop terminates and the loop stops"""


    """It is also important to note that we must end the while loop, somehwere when the loop condition becomes false 
     or else the loop will continue to go on till infinity """
